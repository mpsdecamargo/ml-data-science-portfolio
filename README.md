# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio by Marcos Paulo Santos de Camargo

## Adult Income Classification

This is a small project based on binary classification on an imbalanced dataset. I decided to do it in order to learn and practice my skills by following a tutorial and complementing it based on new methods I learned (Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-Validation).

Note: I know the level of steps taken, such as the Hyperparameter Tuning steps may be overkill for this small dataset, but my purpose was to practice for my next projects.

In this machine learning portfolio project, the focus is on predicting adult income levels based on various demographic and employment-related features. The project involves addressing challenges related to data cleaning and handling imbalanced datasets to build a robust income prediction model.

The primary goal of the Adult Income Prediction project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether an adult's income exceeds a certain threshold, given a set of features such as age, education, occupation, and more. The prediction of income levels is essential for understanding socioeconomic factors and tailoring public policies accordingly.


**Key Skills**: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Classification Task using Machine Learning, Hyperparameter Tuning, Cross Validation.

**Key Libraries** used: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, xgboost, lightgbm.

## BERT Transformer Deep Learning Project

Project Theme: Deep Learning Text Classification using BERT (BERT Base Portuguese, BERT Large Portuguese, Multilingual BERT) language models, as well as derived methods (ALBERT, DISTILBERT, ROBERTA, XLM-ROBERTA, and DEBERTA),

This project is an update of the machine learning notebooks used in developing a Django and React web application as a requirement for earning a degree in Computer Science in Universidade Paulista, Brazil, in 2022.

**Keys Skills** for building datasets and machine learning notebooks along with Semantic Similarity assessment using Sentence-BERT. 

**Tasks**: Data Extraction, Data Preprocessing and Cleaning, Text Binary Classification, Text Multilabel Classification, Semantic Similarity Assessment, Deep Learning Model Configuration and Evaluation, Comparison of Deep Learning Models.

**Key Libraries** used: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, transformers.

**Challenges**: Implementing thorough data preprocessing steps, removing irrelevant information, transforming the data into a format suitable for machine learning models, addressing imbalanced classes in the multilabel classification task, configuring a model for multilabel classification to accurately predict multiple themes for each data point and evaluating models based on various metrics and choosing key metric to compare performance(validation loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score).

## Flight Fare Price Prediction using Regression

This is a project I decided to do to test my EDA and machine learning skills for regression. I additionally developed an optimized model based on the best performing machine learning algorithms.

The objective of the study is to analyse the flight booking dataset obtained from “Ease My Trip” website and to analyse it in order to get meaningful information from it. The 'Linear Regression' statistical algorithm would be used to train the dataset and predict a continuous target variable. 'Easemytrip' is an internet platform for booking flight tickets, and hence a platform that potential passengers use to buy tickets. A thorough study of the data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers.
