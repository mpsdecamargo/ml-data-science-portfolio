## Adult Income Classification

In this machine learning portfolio project, the focus is on predicting adult income levels based on various demographic and employment-related features. The project involves addressing challenges related to data cleaning and handling imbalanced datasets to build a robust income prediction model.

## BERT Transformer Deep Learning Project

Project Theme: Deep Learning Text Classification using BERT (BERT Base Portuguese, BERT Large Portuguese, Multilingual BERT) language models, as well as derived methods (ALBERT, DISTILBERT, ROBERTA, XLM-ROBERTA, and DEBERTA),

This project is an update of the machine learning notebooks used in developing a Django and React web application as a requirement for earning a degree in Computer Science in Universidade Paulista, Brazil, in 2022.

Keys Skills for building datasets and machine learning notebooks along with Semantic Similarity assessment using Sentence-BERT. Tasks: Data Extraction, Data Preprocessing and Cleaning, Text Binary Classification, Text Multilabel Classification, Semantic Similarity Assessment, Deep Learning Model Configuration and Evaluation, Comparison of Deep Learning Models.

Key Libraries used: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, transformers.

Challenges: Implementing thorough data preprocessing steps, removing irrelevant information, transforming the data into a format suitable for machine learning models, addressing imbalanced classes in the multilabel classification task, configuring a model for multilabel classification to accurately predict multiple themes for each data point and evaluating models based on various metrics and choosing key metric to compare performance(validation loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score).
